## Custom Hooks, API functionality in a React Application

Contains two small React applications:

A "Practice" application that uses socket.io to pass information.

A "To-Do" application for small tasks. Uses an API server (https://github.com/doug97703/basic-node-js-api-server) for use in persisting and updating data. 

Both created with React.

### To start:

`npm install`

`npm start`

The API URL variable in todo/src/hooks/api can be easily changed if needed.
